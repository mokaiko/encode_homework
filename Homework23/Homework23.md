# Add pause functionality & interact with the String Utils library

    1. Add pause functionality to your Volcano coin contract
    2. Write a simple function that will interact with the String Utils library. This function should take in a String, and add the literal " from ETH Denver" and return the resulting String and the length of the resulting String.
